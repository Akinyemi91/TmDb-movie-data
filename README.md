# TmDb-movie-data
This was my first project under the 'Investigate the Dataset' module in the ALX Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The project focuses on the effect of time on movies with regards to several variables like popularity, revenue and budget

The original data was sourced from kaggle which shows information about of over 1,000 movies collected from the movie database from 1960 to 2015. 

The dataset contains info on variables like popularity, budget, revenue, original_title and so on.

This project focuses on relationship between different variables per period from the 60s to the 2000s rather than year.

The project also tries to look at the effect of time on movies with regards to popularity and revenue generated and also the relationship between budget and revenues while also factoring inflation.
